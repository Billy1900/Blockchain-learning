# DApp Metrics Framework



# 1. DApp Unified Metrics Framework 
## 1.1 User Behavior Metrics
### 1.1.1 Onboarding Conversion Rate
Onboarding conversion rate measures the percentage of DApp visitors who successfully perform one action in your DApp.
### 1.1.2 Bounce Rate
Bounce rate is the percentage of users who visit a dApp and do not navigate to any other page before leaving.
### 1.1.3 Retention Rate
Retention rate measures what percentage of users who perform an in-dApp action perform another in-dApp action within a certain number of days.
### 1.1.4 Cohort analysis
Cohort analysis measures the extent to which various groups of users engage with your dApp.
## 1.2 Investor Metrics
### 1.2.1 Revenue
pure revenue generated, provide insight into exactly what is driving revenue growth .
### 1.2.2 Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU)
it is most of your revenue coming from a few active users or have you monetized a wide base of users?
### 1.2.3 Lifetime Value to Cost of Acquisition Ratio (LTV:CAC) 
signals the sustainability of revenue growth. If the ratio is too low that signals high cost of acquisition — indicating that current growth may not be sustainable unless subsidized by future funding.
### 1.2.4 Growth Rate
DApp growth rate is defined as the percentage increase in total daily active users on a weekly basis.
### 1.2.5 Viral Coefficient 
the number of users an existing user generates.
### 1.2.6 Promoter Score
Anyone answering in the 0–6 range is considered a detractor, 7–8 range a passive user, and anyone in the 9 to 10 range is considered a promoter.

# 2. Metrics from Dapp.com
## 2.1 Metrics
- User statistics: New users / New accounts interact with the dapp contracts in one day; Daily users / Total accounts interact with the dapp contracts in one day.
-	Transaction statistics: Daily transactions - Transactions of the contracts in one day; Non-zero transactions - Daily Transactions with the non-zero value.
-	Contract statistics: Dapp balance / Total balance of dapp contracts; Dapp volume / Total volume of dapp transactions.
## 2.2 scores
Make all those metrics as scoring from 2.1, the scores are based on:
-	Its user number, including new users and daily active users.
-	Transaction amount, including daily transaction volume with non-zero value.
-	Contract balance, including total dapp contract balance and the total volume of dapp transactions.
We consider any dapp with above 20 scores is a healthy dapp.


# 3. New version Dapp.com
Dapp.com Ranking considers the contract performance, user quality, and community performance.
## 3.1 Metrics
1. Daily Interactive Users (DIU): The number of accounts (users) that interact with the dapp’s smart contracts.

2. Quality of Users: There’s a huge difference between a user with 0.01 ETH in the account and the one 100 ETH in the account, and we consider the one with 100 ETH is a high-quality user.

3. Transaction Amount: It includes non-zero transactions (usually purchases) and zero transactions (actions).

4. Funding Sources of User Accounts: It purges bots and fake users whose funds are from the dapp’s contracts through multiple transfers.

5. User’s Attention: If a user account has 5 out of 10 contract-related activities with a dapp in one day, we consider he/she has high attention to this dapp.

6. Timeliness of User Actions: If a user’s last contribution to a dapp was a few months ago, then his/her recent action(s) to the dapp should reflect differences in its dapp ranking.

7. Community: It includes the community size and activeness. A community is formed by its loyal supporters and users who join the entire journey, from the dapp development to the expansion. It not only shows the potential to grow but also reflects the team’s capability of operations.
## 3.2 Scores
Since the Dapp.com Ranking is a linearly cumulative continuous function that decays exponentially over time, the ranking scores are continuously distributed from 0–100. The following scale can be used as references:
-	Ranking score 80–100: Top tier dapp. It has a solid user base and “high-quality” users, as well as an active community with high engagement.
-	Ranking score 60–80: Good dapp. It means the current dapp status is generally healthy. There may be differences in the scale of effective user transaction and community activity compared to higher-score dapps.
-	Ranking score below 60: The dapp may have just released or currently still under development of major functions. Its user base and the number of valid transactions are relatively small. And also the community development is in an early stage. It might be risky sometime when the dapp is categorized as betting or built a Ponzi scheme.
